This software was written by Alexander Peslyak in 2001.  No copyright is
claimed, and the software is hereby placed in the public domain.
In case this attempt to disclaim copyright and place the software in the
public domain is deemed null and void, then the software is
Copyright (c) 2001 Alexander Peslyak and it is hereby released to the
general public under the following terms:

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted.

There's ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, express or implied.

(This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)

This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
the properties of the two independent implementations.

The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
compile-time configuration.

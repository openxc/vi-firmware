/**
 * @brief This command sets the TX power level of the BlueNRG.
 * @note  By controlling the EN_HIGH_POWER and the PA_LEVEL, the combination of the 2 determines
 *        the output power level (dBm).
 *        When the system starts up or reboots, the default TX power level will be used, which is
 *        the maximum value of 8dBm. Once this command is given, the output power will be changed
 *        instantly, regardless if there is Bluetooth communication going on or not. For example,
 *        for debugging purpose, the BlueNRG can be set to advertise all the time and use this
 *        command to observe the signal strength changing. The system will keep the last received
 *        TX power level from the command, i.e. the 2nd command overwrites the previous TX power
 *        level. The new TX power level remains until another Set TX Power command, or the system
 *        reboots.\n
 * @param en_high_power Can be only 0 or 1. Set high power bit on or off. It is strongly adviced to use the
 * 						right value, depending on the selected hardware configuration for the RF network:
 * 						normal mode or high power mode.
 * @param pa_level Can be from 0 to 7. Set the PA level value.
 * @return Value indicating success or error code.

 *        have been transmitted. This command can be used to check how many packets have been sent
 *        during the Direct TX test.\n
 *        The counter starts from 0 and counts upwards. The counter can wrap and start from 0 again.
 *        The counter is not cleared until the next Direct TX test starts.
 * @param[out] number_of_packets Number of packets sent during the last Direct TX test.

/**
 * @brief Put the device in standby mode.
 * @note Normally the BlueNRG will automatically enter sleep mode to save power. This command puts the
 * 		 device into the Standby mode instead of the sleep mode. The difference is that, in sleep mode,
 * 		 the device can still wake up itself with the internal timer. But in standby mode, this timer is
 * 		 disabled. So the only possibility to wake up the device is by external signals, e.g. a HCI command
 * 		 sent via SPI bus.
 * 		 The command is only accepted when there is no other Bluetooth activity. Otherwise an error code
 * 		 ERR_COMMAND_DISALLOWED will be returned.

 * 		  This command shouldn't be used when normal Bluetooth activities are ongoing.
 * 		  The tone should be stopped by aci_hal_tone_stop() command.
